Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable.

Java is a platform Independent: – Platform independent means java can run on any computer irrespective to the hardware and software dependency. Means Java does not depend on hardware means what type of processor , RAM etc.

Building an Android app comes down to two major skills/languages: Java and Android. Java is the language used in Android, but the Android part encompasses learning XML for the design of the app, learning the concepts of Android, and using the concepts programmatically with Java.

Once you learn Java and XML (XML is really easy to get used to, and you should learn the language as you program your app rather than learning it beforehand like you would with Java), you need to learn how to connect these two using Android principles.

For a total beginner, I recommend learning Java. There are no shortcuts here, you just have to learn Java.

Now for a total beginner, I recommend YouTube tutorials to get the basic idea of how to install Eclipse (the Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, for Java) and the Java Development Kit (JDK). But after learning the very basics, don't continue on YouTube tutorials, 'cause they don't give you ideas on the important concepts. 

Eclipse and android studio are the IDEs recommended for a beginner.

### 5 THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE BUILDING YOUR FIRST ANDROID APP:

* You need to learn Java, there is no way around it
* Android part encompasses learning XML for the app design, understanding concepts of Android and using said concepts programmatically with Java
* Beginners should probably use an IDE (We prefer Android Studio over Eclipse)
* Building your first app is time-consuming: it won't happen overnight. This is not a project for those looking for a fast result
* When stuck on a problem (which will inevitably happen), turn to Stack Overflow. If no luck there, look to the Android Subreddit where there is a helpful community


For more details on android studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
everything from setting up to using android studio is documented here.

So learn java and more java then android then app creation, it's a long way.Well actually not but if you think so , but have an excellent idea for an app then why wait for java you can use MIT app inventor ,CURIOUS..
