Web based projects can be anything to a website like Facebook, youtube, github. Or something like our college website, our attendance viewer are all web based projects but are not open source. 

Web based projects has two parts Frontend and Backend, read more about it here, https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/film-games/whats-difference-front-end-back-end


## 2.1 Frontend

Frontend is basically what you see, the colors, the animations, the wonderful pictures, people with creativity basically does this. It is the most easy of all the projects and the scope and amount of projects for frontend development is very high.

### Technologies needed: 


* ### HTML

  HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text  Markup  Language. HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup.

## 2.2 BACKEND

When you're building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc.

Luckily for you, other people long ago noticed that web developers face similar problems when building a new site, so they teamed up and created frameworks  that give you ready-made components to use.


Your website or dynamic web application is a sum of layers—structure, design and content, and functionality. The technology and programming that “power” a site—what your end user doesn’t see but what makes the site run—is called the back end. Consisting of the server, the database, and the server-side applications, it’s the behind-the-scenes functionality—the brain of a site. This is the ecosystem of the database manager and the back-end developer.


### Major Web-Frameworks and  Technologies Needed

* ### Django or Flask
  If you're already knowledgeble in Python and interested in Web Development, I suggest you start with learning Django or Flask, Django is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python Instagram, National Geographic, Mozilla, Pintrest are some websites which run on django. Flask is a lighter version of Django

* ### Ruby on Rails
   Rails like Django is also a free and open source web application but written in Ruby.                                        Codecademy,twitter(old version),plated,github are some sites build over Rails.

* ### Node.js
  Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and  networking  applications. Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules  which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.
