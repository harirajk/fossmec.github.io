Modern computers are becoming more and more intelligent as time passes. Most of this is/can be attributed to machine learning. The definition of machine learning is that it is "a method to achieve artificial intelligence (AI) that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

Machine learning is an essential skill in most of IoT applications that are developed today. What more to say, it is built into most of the applications that we all use everyday! 
Learning how to teach your machine to learn will be an important asset in your programming career.
There are thousands of machine learning projects.

Some references for Machine Learning is provided below:

# 5. Android Application Development Using Java

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable.

Java is a platform Independent: – Platform independent means java can run on any computer irrespective to the hardware and software dependency. Means Java does not depend on hardware means what type of processor , RAM etc.

Building an Android app comes down to two major skills/languages: Java and Android. Java is the language used in Android, but the Android part encompasses learning XML for the design of the app, learning the concepts of Android, and using the concepts programmatically with Java.

Once you learn Java and XML (XML is really easy to get used to, and you should learn the language as you program your app rather than learning it beforehand like you would with Java), you need to learn how to connect these two using Android principles.

For a total beginner, I recommend learning Java. There are no shortcuts here, you just have to learn Java.

Now for a total beginner, I recommend YouTube tutorials to get the basic idea of how to install Eclipse (the Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, for Java) and the Java Development Kit (JDK). But after learning the very basics, don't continue on YouTube tutorials, 'cause they don't give you ideas on the important concepts. 

Eclipse and android studio are the IDEs recommended for a beginner.

### 5 THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE BUILDING YOUR FIRST ANDROID APP:

* You need to learn Java, there is no way around it
* Android part encompasses learning XML for the app design, understanding concepts of Android and using said concepts programmatically with Java
* Beginners should probably use an IDE (We prefer Android Studio over Eclipse)
* Building your first app is time-consuming: it won't happen overnight. This is not a project for those looking for a fast result
* When stuck on a problem (which will inevitably happen), turn to Stack Overflow. If no luck there, look to the Android Subreddit where there is a helpful community


For more details on android studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
everything from setting up to using android studio is documented here.

So learn java and more java then android then app creation, it's a long way.Well actually not but if you think so , but have an excellent idea for an app then why wait for java you can use MIT app inventor ,CURIOUS..

# 6. Google Summer of Code || Google Code-In

Google Code-in is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open source software development. Since 2010, over 3200 students from 99 countries have completed work in the contest.

Because Google Code-in is often the first experience many students have with open source, the contest is designed to make it easy for students to jump right in. Open source organizations chosen by Google provide a list of tasks for students to work on during the seven week contest period. A unique part of the contest is that each task has mentors from the organization assigned should students have questions or need help along the way.

Open source organizations that have participated in a previous Google Code-in or Google Summer of Code program are eligible to apply to be mentor organizations for Google Code-in. Mentor organizations create hundreds of tasks for students to work on during the contest period and are responsible for assigning mentors to help students with questions and to review students’ work on the tasks.

Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university.

Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together 12,000+ student participants and 11,000 mentors from over 127 countries worldwide. Google Summer of Code has produced 30,000,000+ lines of code for 568 open source organizations. 
As a part of Google Summer of Code, student participants are paired with a mentor from the participating organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development and techniques. Students have the opportunity to spend the break between their school semesters earning a stipend while working in areas related to their interests and also pay $5500 for participating.

In turn, the participating organizations are able to identify and bring in new developers who implement new features and hopefully continue to contribute to open source even after the program is over. Most importantly, more code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.
