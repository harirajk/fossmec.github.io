A scripting language is a programming language that employs a high-level construct to interpret and execute one command at a time. In general, scripting languages are easier to learn and faster to code in than more structured and compiled languages such as C and C++. It is always adviced to learn a scripting language because it has a large scope of use.

## 1.2 Shell Scripting

Shell scripts allow us to program commands in chains and have the system execute them as a scripted event, just like          batch files.Scripting allows you to use programming functions – such as ‘for’ loops, if/then/else statements, and so         forth – directly within your operating system’s interface.
